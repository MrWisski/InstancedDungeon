# InstancedDungeon
A Bukkit Plugin to provide instanced Dungeons

This is a WIP Bukkit plugin (and eventually, Sponge plugin) to create "Dungeons" (Bits of a map), and then replicate them on demand, giving a user their own one-time-use area called an "Instance". When the player is done with their Instance, it is removed from the map.

Requirements :
1) WorldEdit (5.6.3).
2) AsynchWorldEdit (1.5).
3) MultiWorld (5.2.4-ish)
4) WorldGuard (5.9)
